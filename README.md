# Hangman Game
 A Hang-Man Game using Java
 
Developed a classic Hangman game using Java, which involved designing an interactive interface for users to guess the hidden word by selecting letters. Implemented the game's logic with a variety of features, including a scoring system, difficulty levels, and the ability to choose from a selection of word categories. Utilized object-oriented programming principles to create a maintainable and extensible codebase, and tested the application thoroughly to ensure its functionality and user-friendliness.
